Ever since I was little all I have wanted to do was travel. I love discovering new places and exploring them to the max. All I want to do in the future is to hike and climb and explore new places. I want to travel and explore, if only it was a real job. Most people might say that they were just born that way, and others say they had to find their inner explorer. Me, I came out of the womb holding a trail map of the whole Appalachian Trail. If I had to choose my favorite vacation it would be hiking through the trees in Yosemite National Park. Or the day trips to the rock climbing gym, are ten times more fun for me than shopping. Sure the beach and relaxing at a beach house is nice but if I had a say we would be ocean kayaking instead. If I am to be honest I'm probably not having the greatest time if there is not any bit of danger involved. Many people think I might have gotten it from living in a house full of boys, but then I tell them I only have two sisters. There is no way to explain my strong interest in adventure and travel, then that it is just who I am.
